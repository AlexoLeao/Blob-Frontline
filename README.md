**Blob Frontines**

  Blob Frontlines will be a mmo top down shooter inspired by "Fox Hole" and "Battlefield".
  The idea is to have simple, diverse, and fun game mechanics, to mimic full fps gameplay, but in a top-down shooter.
  To have capturable map sectors, which are captured by the team with more elements in that sector, and/or by capturing a "cap" zone, flag, or building.
  It would be great to have diverse themes, WW1 maps, usable trenches and bunkers, static machine guns, WW2, more advanced themes, etc...
  Initially, priority should be infantry combat, player movement, weapon handling satisfaction, large scale team battles over the sectors ("Planet Side 2" facility captures for example)
  Later, the idea is to have vehicles, buildable structures, other gamemodes, skins (probably camouflages, infantry uniforms)
